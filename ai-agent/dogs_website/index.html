Consider the following statements about a website about dogs:

1. If a website has an icon, then it is a complete HTML file.
2. A website with a header that includes a title and navigation links is a complete HTML file.
3. Every complete HTML file contains a footer with copyright information.
4. A website can't be considered a complete HTML file if there are no navigation links in the header.

You have been given three websites to evaluate:

1. Website A has an icon, but does not include any navigation links in its header. 
2. Website B includes a title and navigation links in its header, yet it doesn't have a footer with copyright information.
3. Website C has both a footer with copyright information and no icon, but lacks title and navigation links in the header.

Question: Which of the given websites are complete HTML files?


We know that to be considered as an HTML file, each website must meet the conditions listed above (icon, title in header, navigation links in header, and a footer with copyright information). Let's apply these rules to our three websites.

We can start by applying the first rule: if a website has an icon, then it is a complete HTML file. We know that Website A does have an icon, so we can consider it as a potential HTML file.

Moving on to the second rule: a website with a header that includes a title and navigation links is a complete HTML file. This means that if a website has neither of these elements in its header, then it cannot be a complete HTML file. Neither Website B nor Website C include a title and navigation links in their headers, so they can't be considered as HTML files.

Lastly, we apply the third rule: every complete HTML file contains a footer with copyright information. Since Website A doesn't contain this element in its header, we can't confirm that it is an HTML file based on this rule. However, considering Steps 1 and 2, there's a chance that Website A might still be considered as HTML.

Answer: Based on the given rules, only Website A can be considered as a complete HTML file. The other websites (Websites B and C) do not meet all the criteria for being an HTML file.
